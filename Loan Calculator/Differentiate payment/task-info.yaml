    Wrong answer in test #3

    Looks like your annuity payments calculations aren't working properly. Correct annuity payment and overpayment are [ 37104, 129638 ], but you output: ['129638.0', '92534.0']

    Please find below the output of your program during this failed test.

    ---

    Arguments: --type=annuity --principal=1000000 --periods=8 --interest=9.8

    Your monthly payment = 129638.0 and the last payment = 92534.0.
